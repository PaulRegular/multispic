## TODO:
## - Calculate one-step ahead residuals

## - Add data from 2J3K and 3Ps eco-regions <-- done
## - Fit to each region (single-species, 5 species, 10 species, all species)
## - Try to combine regions (K_group = ~region) <-- possible, but too many correlation parameters, many of which may not make sense to estimate (e.g. cod in 3Ps vs. redfish in 2J3K)
## - Calculate species-specific leave one out scores to assess predictive ability of each model
## - Hypothesis: multispecies >> single-species inference

## - Write ecological oriented paper; aim for PNAS or Fish and Fisheries

## - Introduce break point for the K @ 1991 <-- done
## - Add NL climate index <-- done
## - Add capelin?? <-- limited by spatial and temporal coverage of survey
## - Fix Campelen index to 1 for cod? <-- would not converge, but did improve priors for catchability

## Consider:
## - make a tidy_par function and name par using factor levels
## - consider imposing a mean change in the collapse era (current fit is using K to cause the collapse)
## - consider dropping approximate uniform prior option

## Dev notes:
## - Forcing the RW structure results in unusual process errors for some species
## - During testing the fixed, random, and uniform_prior options rarely converged
