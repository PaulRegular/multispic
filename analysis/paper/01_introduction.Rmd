K = cornerstone in population ecology

Paragraph ideas:

- Carrying capacity, the concept that a environment can only accommodate a finite number of specific species, is a foundational concept in applied population ecology (e.g., use of MSY in fisheries management).
- Usefulness of this concept has been called into question (e.g., changing K in variable environments). Standard formulations also tend to focus on single-species and ignore species interactions. 
- We propose an extension of single-species production model that assumes that inter and intra-specific competition contributes to density-dependent effects within ecosystem production units.
- Apply the model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada.

The concept of carrying capacity is fundamental in applied population ecology and is often used in managing natural resources, such as fisheries. However, the usefulness of the concept has been questioned, particularly in variable environments where carrying capacity may change. Additionally, standard formulations of carrying capacity have traditionally focused on single-species models and have ignored the role of species interactions.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the single-species production model that incorporates the impact of inter and intra-specific competition on density-dependent effects within ecosystem production units. Our multispecies production model is designed to account for a greater number of ecological interactions than traditional single-species models, providing a more accurate representation of the complex ecological systems in which these species are found.

We applied our model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada, specifically focusing on the Northeast Newfoundland Shelf, Grand Bank, and Southern Newfoundland. Our study aimed to assess the potential utility of multispecies production models in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the population dynamics of these species, as well as to identify potential limitations of the model. Through our study, we sought to contribute to a better understanding of how carrying capacity and other ecological concepts can be applied to complex, multispecies ecosystems.

**ChatGPT text for discussion that may work in the intro**

Carrying capacity, defined as the maximum number of individuals of a species that can be supported by a given environment, has traditionally been a cornerstone of population ecology. However, this concept is often oversimplified by assuming that species exist in isolation from one another and that the environment has a fixed capacity for each species.

Effective fisheries management is essential for the sustainable utilization of marine resources and the maintenance of ecosystem health. Traditional single-species approaches, centered around concepts like maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and carrying capacity, have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of individual target species. However, the complexities of marine ecosystems and the interdependence among species necessitate a shift towards an ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approach. EBFM recognizes that the well-being of target species is intimately linked to the overall health and functioning of the ecosystem in which they reside.

Transitioning from single-species management to EBFM poses significant challenges. The conventional models, often based on simplistic assumptions and focused solely on a target species, fail to capture the intricate interactions and feedback mechanisms that shape ecosystem dynamics. Moreover, they may overlook the impacts of non-target species, leading to unintended ecological consequences. To address these limitations and move towards a more comprehensive and sustainable approach, it is imperative to develop models that account for species interactions, density-dependent effects, and the broader ecosystem context.

In this context, we propose a state-space multispecies production model as a promising tool to bridge the gap between single-species management and EBFM. By explicitly incorporating inter and intra-specific competition and considering density-dependent effects within ecosystem production units, this model offers a more comprehensive framework for estimating population parameters and assessing the productivity of multiple species within an ecosystem. By doing so, it facilitates a better understanding of species interactions, trophic dynamics, and the overall functioning of the ecosystem.

Our study focuses on the commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada as a case study for applying the state-space multispecies production model. The eastern Canadian waters harbor a diverse assemblage of species with complex ecological relationships. By analyzing the population dynamics of this demersal fish assemblage using our proposed model, we aim to shed light on the intricacies of species interactions and density-dependent effects within the context of EBFM.

The incorporation of a multispecies production model within EBFM represents a significant step forward in fisheries management. It enables the consideration of broader ecosystem indicators, such as trophic cascades, species resilience, and ecosystem stability, providing a more holistic understanding of the system's dynamics. By embracing a multispecies perspective, management strategies can be developed to safeguard not only the target species but also the entire ecosystem, including the habitats and non-target species that contribute to its integrity.

Our research objectives encompass two primary components. Firstly, we aim to assess the performance of the state-space multispecies production model in capturing the complexities of species interactions and density-dependent effects within the demersal fish assemblage off the east coast of Canada. Secondly, we seek to utilize the model outputs to inform and support the implementation of EBFM strategies tailored to the region's unique ecological context.

Through our study, we aim to address the challenges associated with transitioning to EBFM and demonstrate the potential of a multispecies production model to enhance the understanding of ecosystem dynamics and inform management decisions. By bridging the gap between single-species approaches and EBFM, our research contributes to the ongoing efforts to achieve sustainable fisheries management that considers the broader ecological context and promotes the long-term resilience of marine ecosystems.

In the subsequent sections of this paper, we will present a comprehensive analysis of our proposed state-space multispecies production model, discuss the key findings, and examine their implications for EBFM. Furthermore, we will review relevant literature, highlighting the complexities and importance of adopting an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.

In summary, the shift towards ecosystem-based fisheries management requires novel tools that can capture the complexities of marine ecosystems and species interactions. The state-space multispecies production model offers a promising avenue to bridge the gap between single-species management and EBFM,

 enabling a more comprehensive understanding of population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. By applying this model to the demersal fish assemblage off the east coast of Canada, our study contributes to the advancement of sustainable fisheries management strategies in an ecologically significant region.
