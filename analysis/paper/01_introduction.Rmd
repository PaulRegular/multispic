- Carrying capacity, the concept that a environment can only accommodate a finite number of specific species, is a foundational concept in applied population ecology (e.g., use of MSY in fisheries management).
- Usefulness of this concept has been called into question (e.g., changing K in variable environments). Standard formulations also tend to focus on single-species and ignore species interactions. 
- We propose an extension of single-species production model that assumes that inter and intra-specific competition contributes to density-dependent effects within ecosystem production units.

The concept of carrying capacity is fundamental in applied population ecology and is often used in managing natural resources, such as fisheries. However, the usefulness of the concept has been questioned, particularly in variable environments where carrying capacity may change. Additionally, standard formulations of carrying capacity have traditionally focused on single-species models and have ignored the role of species interactions.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the single-species production model that incorporates the impact of inter and intra-specific competition on density-dependent effects within ecosystem production units. Our multispecies production model is designed to account for a greater number of ecological interactions than traditional single-species models, providing a more accurate representation of the complex ecological systems in which these species are found.

We applied our model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada, specifically focusing on the Northeast Newfoundland Shelf, Grand Bank, and Southern Newfoundland. Our study aimed to assess the potential utility of multispecies production models in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the population dynamics of these species, as well as to identify potential limitations of the model. Through our study, we sought to contribute to a better understanding of how carrying capacity and other ecological concepts can be applied to complex, multispecies ecosystems.
