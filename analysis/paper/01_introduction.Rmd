The concept of carrying capacity has long been foundational in applied population ecology, being widely used in the management of renewable resources [@hilborn1995; @chapman2018]. The understanding that populations often produce more offspring than an environment can sustain led to the notion that the 'surplus' can be harvest sustainablly [@pauly2021]. These ideas are exemplified by the use of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the classic single-species surplus production modeling framework [@schaefer1954]. In one equation, this framework attempts to explain interannual changes in biomass using fisheries landings and estimates of intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity. Given the theoretical elegance of the approach, it has been both widely adopted and criticized. Estimates of carrying capacity, and resultant derivations of MSY, are frequently criticized for being time-invariant, which is an over-simplification in variable environments [@del2004]. Moreover, traditional surplus production models tend to focus on single-species dynamics and often disregard the complexities arising from species interactions within ecosystems [@gamble2009].

The concept of carrying capacity is fundamental in applied population ecology and is often used in managing natural resources, such as fisheries. However, the usefulness of the concept has been questioned, particularly in variable environments where carrying capacity may change. Additionally, standard formulations of carrying capacity have traditionally focused on single-species models and have ignored the role of species interactions.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the single-species production model that incorporates the impact of inter and intra-specific competition on density-dependent effects within ecosystem production units. Our multispecies production model is designed to account for a greater number of ecological interactions than traditional single-species models, providing a more accurate representation of the complex ecological systems in which these species are found.

We applied our model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada, specifically focusing on the Northeast Newfoundland Shelf, Grand Bank, and Southern Newfoundland. Our study aimed to assess the potential utility of multispecies production models in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the population dynamics of these species, as well as to identify potential limitations of the model. Through our study, we sought to contribute to a better understanding of how carrying capacity and other ecological concepts can be applied to complex, multispecies ecosystems.

Carrying capacity, defined as the maximum number of individuals of a species that can be supported by a given environment, has traditionally been a cornerstone of population ecology. However, this concept is often oversimplified by assuming that species exist in isolation from one another and that the environment has a fixed capacity for each species.

Introduction:

Carrying capacity, a fundamental concept in applied population ecology, plays a central role in fisheries management, exemplified by the use of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the classic single-species surplus production modeling framework. This concept defines the maximum number of individuals a given environment can support sustainably. However, the utility of carrying capacity has been questioned due to its dynamic nature, particularly in variable environments where it may change over time. Moreover, traditional formulations of carrying capacity tend to focus on single-species dynamics and often disregard the complexities arising from species interactions within ecosystems.

Recognizing the limitations of single-species management and the need for a more comprehensive approach, there have been calls to shift towards an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management (EBFM). EBFM acknowledges the intricate web of ecological interactions and aims to ensure the sustainability and integrity of marine ecosystems while supporting viable fisheries. To successfully implement EBFM, it is crucial to develop models that account for species interactions and the dynamics of multiple species within the ecosystem.

Multispecies models emerge as a critical tool in supporting EBFM. These models incorporate species interactions, density-dependent effects, and other ecological factors, allowing for a more holistic understanding of population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. By considering the impacts of fishing on single-species while also accounting for species interactions, multispecies models offer a promising avenue for reconciling the complexities of managing multiple species within a dynamic ecosystem.

Although substantial progress has been made in the development of multispecies models, their implementation can be hindered by data limitations and knowledge gaps. Nevertheless, even in data-limited situations, multispecies models provide valuable insights by integrating available information and generating robust estimates of population dynamics. These models represent a step forward in understanding the complexities of ecosystems and provide a foundation for informed decision-making in fisheries management.

In this paper, we bridge concepts from single-species surplus production modeling and multispecies modeling to construct a comprehensive model that incorporates the impacts of fishing on single-species populations and accounts for species interactions within the ecosystem. We apply this model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada, aiming to improve our understanding of population dynamics and the implications for sustainable fisheries management within this specific context.

By investigating the dynamics of multiple species and their interactions, we contribute to the advancement of EBFM and provide insights into the potential of multispecies modeling to enhance population estimates and inform management strategies for the studied demersal fish assemblage. The subsequent sections of this paper will present the conceptual framework of our model, describe its application to the demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada, and discuss the implications of our findings for ecosystem-based fisheries management. Additionally, we will review pertinent literature that underscores the importance of considering species interactions and incorporating multispecies approaches in fisheries management.
