## Model formulation {-}

Trends in fish populations have frequently been described using state-space biomass dynamic models of the form

\begin{align}
B_y =& \left ( B_{y-1} + g(B_{y - 1}) - C_{y - 1} \right ) e^{\delta_y} & (\#eq:pro) \\
\\
I_{y, i} =& q_i B_y e^{\varepsilon_{y, i}} & (\#eq:obs)
\end{align}

where $B_y$ is biomass at the start of year $y$, $C_y$ is the catch through year $y$, $g(B)$ is production as a function of biomass, $I_{y,s}$ is an index of relative abundance in year $y$ from survey $i$, $q_i$ is the time-invariant catchability coefficient for survey index $i$, $\delta$ is process error, and $\varepsilon$ is observation error. Statistical challenges aside, the most difficult aspect of this model to parameterize is the production function as it needs to capture changes caused by growth, recruitment, and natural mortality. Schaefer [-@schaefer1954] proposed a solution by applying the logistic equation to describe self-limiting growth, 

\begin{align}
g(B) = rB \left( 1 - \frac{B}{K} \right), & (\#eq:logistic)
\end{align}

where $r$ is the maximum per-capita rate of change and $K$ is the carrying capacity. That is, a populations' intrinsic ability to grow ($rB$) is limited by the size of the current population relative to the maximum biomass the system can support ($1 - B/K$). While this formulation offers an elegant description of single-species population dynamics, it assumes that density-dependent effects are solely caused by intraspecific competition and ignores the potential effects of other species inhabiting the same ecological area. We present an extension of equation \@ref(eq:logistic) that attempts to account for intra and interspecific competition by assuming that density-dependent effects are incurred when the total biomass of multiple species, represented by $s$, exceeds the capacity of the system, 

\begin{align}
g(B_s) = r_s B_s \left (1 - \frac{\sum_{s} B_s}{K} \right ). & (\#eq:ms-logistic)
\end{align}

While intrinsic rates of growth may vary across species, this formulation implies that the growth of all species is ultimately limited by the finite amount of energy in a region (i.e., as the population in the system increases towards $K$, year-over-year growth of all species slows). Combining equations \@ref(eq:pro), \@ref(eq:obs), and \@ref(eq:ms-logistic), our model becomes

\begin{align}
B_{y, s} =& \left ( B_{y-1, s} + r_s B_{y-1, s} \left (1 - \frac{\sum_{s} B_{y-1, s}}{K} \right ) - C_{y - 1, s} \right ) e^{\delta_{y, s}} & (\#eq:ms-pro) \\
\\
I_{y, i, s} =& q_{i, s} B_{y, s} e^{\varepsilon_{y, i, s}}. & (\#eq:ms-obs)
\end{align}

The inclusion of multiple species in the model permits the estimation of covariance. While covarying changes in observed populations may be described using observation errors, we assume that most covariance stems from population processes. We therefore assume that observation errors are independent and normal distribution such that $\varepsilon_{y, i, s} \sim N(0, \tau_{i, s})$, where the standard deviation parameter $\tau_{i, s}$ represents species and survey specific levels of observation error. A more flexible error structure is used to describe the process errors as ecological processes may contribute to species or temporal dependencies. Beyond the global limiting effect of $K$, species interactions may elicit positive or negative population responses resulting from direct or indirect associations. We therefore apply the multivariate normal distribution to account for the possibility that process errors are not independent across species. Deviations from expected production may also display temporal dependence if the factors contributing to the process errors change slowly through time. Such inertia may cause positive or negative process errors to persist across several years. A first-order autoregressive (AR1) process was therefore applied to account for temporal dependence. Both sources of dependence are modeled using a multivariate AR1 process where

\begin{align}
\delta_{0, s} \sim& N(0, \Sigma_s) & \\
\delta_{1, s} =& \phi \delta_{0} + \sigma_s \varepsilon_{1}, \quad \varepsilon_{1} \sim N(0, \Sigma_s)  & (\#eq:ar1) \\
\delta_{y, s} =& \phi \delta_{y - 1} + \sigma_s \varepsilon_{y}, \quad \varepsilon_{y} \sim N(0, \Sigma_s) & 
\end{align}

and

\begin{align}
\Sigma_s = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^2_{1} &  \sigma_{1} \sigma_{2} \rho_{1,2}  & \dots &  \sigma_{1} \sigma_{s} \rho_{1,s} & \\
\sigma_{2} \sigma_{1} \rho_{2,1}       & \sigma^2_{2}     & \dots & \sigma_{2} \sigma_{s} \rho_{2,s}  & \\
\vdots & \vdots &  \ddots     &  \vdots & \\
\sigma_{s} \sigma_{1} \rho_{s,1} & \sigma_{s} \sigma_{2} \rho_{s,2} & \dots  &  \sigma^2_{s} &
\end{bmatrix}. & (\#eq:sigma)
\end{align}

The degree of temporal correlation is controlled by $\phi$, where values between 0 to 1 represent low to high correlation, and species-to-species correlations are described by $\rho_{s, s}$, where values between -1 to 1 represent negative to positive correlation. This is a flexible structure that allows for the testing of alternate hypotheses that process errors are independent through time or across species (i.e, $\phi = 0$ or $\rho_{s, s} = 0$). The possibility that process errors are similarly correlated across all species may also be tested by estimating only one $\rho$ parameter. Finally, the magnitude of the process error deviations are controlled by the species-specific standard deviation parameters, $\sigma_s$.

Finally, the formulation allows the fitting of covariates that may describe an underlying linear effect. Two options were implemented, one that affects the process errors by substituting $e^{\delta{y,s}}$ in equation \@ref(eq:ms-pro) with $e^{\beta_{\delta} X^{\delta}_{y,s} + \delta_{y, s}}$, and another that affects the carrying capacity by substituting $K$ in equation \@ref(eq:ms-pro) with $K e^{\beta_K X^K_{y}}$. The idea is that some factors may affect positive or negative changes in the populations while others may affect change in the total carrying capacity of the system. A covariate option for intrinsic rates of increase was not implemented as one goal of this model is to obtain estimates of this vital rate, which is not expected to change rapidly as it is shaped by natural selection [@hutchings2021].



<!-- Here I present initial results from of a Shaffer surplus production model which has been modified to fit to multiple species: -->

<!-- $$B_{t, s} = \left (B_{t-1, s} + r_s B_{t-1, s} \left (1 - \left[ \frac{\sum_{s} B_{t-1, s}}{K} \right ] \right ) - L_{t-1, s} \right ) e^ {\beta X_t + {\delta_{t,s}}}$$ where -->

<!-- $$ \delta_{t,s} \sim N(0, \Sigma_s)$$ and -->

<!-- $$ \Sigma_s = \begin{bmatrix} -->
<!-- \sigma^2_{\delta~1} &  \sigma_{\delta~1} \sigma_{\delta~2} \rho_{1,2}  & \dots &  \sigma_{\delta~1} \sigma_{\delta~s} \rho_{1,s} & \\  -->
<!-- \sigma_{\delta~2} \sigma_{\delta~1} \rho_{2,1}       & \sigma^2_{\delta~2}     & \dots & \sigma_{\delta~2} \sigma_{\delta~s} \rho_{2,s}  & \\  -->
<!-- \vdots & \vdots &  \ddots     &  \vdots & \\  -->
<!-- \sigma_{\delta~s} \sigma_{\delta~1} \rho_{s,1} & \sigma_{\delta~s} \sigma_{\delta~2} \rho_{s,2} & \dots  &  \sigma^2_{\delta~s} &  -->
<!-- \end{bmatrix} $$ -->

<!-- The key difference here from a standard surplus production model is that biomass is indexed by species, $s$, and the ratio of biomass over carrying capacity is based on the total biomass of the species included in the model. Note that intrinsic growth rates, $r_s$, are species specific while only one carrying capacity $K$ parameter is estimated. Therefore, as the population in the system increases towards $K$, year-over-year growth of all species slows. The concept is that the species included in the model are limited by the finite amount of energy in the system. Another difference is the way the process error is modeled. Because multiple species are included, covariance between the species can be estimated. Here I model process error using the multivariate normal distribution and estimate standard deviation parameters ($\sigma^2_{\delta ~ s}$) for each species as well as the correlation in the errors across species ($\rho_{s,s}$). If these species are affected by similar drivers, then correlations will be positive. Alternatively, negative correlations may occur if there is competition or predator-prey interactions between two species. Finally, the formulation allows the fitting of covariates that may describe an underlying linear effect ($\beta X$). -->

<!-- The observation portion of this state-space model is -->

<!-- $$I_{t,s,g} = q_{s,g} ~ B_{t,s} ~ e^{\nu}$$ where -->

<!-- $$\nu \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\nu ~ s,g})$$ Here $g$ represents survey grouping (e.g. season, gear). This allows for the catachability and variability of surveys to be species and survey specific. This model was constructed using Template Model Builder. -->

<!-- ### Data and priors -->

<!-- As a first-cut exploration, I apply this model to several groundfish species on the Grand Bank (3LNO): Yellowtail, Witch, Cod, Plaice, Skate, Hake, Haddock, Redfish. Landings data were obtained from the STATLANT21A database maintained by NAFO (<https://www.nafo.int/Data/STATLANT>). Survey indices are from Canadian spring and fall multispecies surveys. Three gear changes have occurred throughout the survey time-series, from Yankee, Engel and Campelen gear. Coverage of the Grand Bank has been inconsistent and, as such, the data has been restricted to years where 90% of the core area (strata that have been sampled for more than 20 years) has been covered by the survey. Separate catchabilities are estimated by season and gear type. -->

<!-- The same prior (mean = -1, sd = 1) was used on $log(r)$, $log(\sigma^2_{\delta ~ s})$, $log(q_{s,g})$ and $log(\sigma^2_{\nu ~ s,g})$, which corresponds to 95% interval of 0.05 and 2.61. These general priors stabilized convergence by penalizing large deviations into unrealistic parameter space \[i.e. growth ($r$), catchability ($q$) and variance ($\sigma^2$) parameters are not expected to move far outside the 0.05 - 2.61 range\]. -->

<!-- ### Model selection -->

<!-- A range of models have been tested and compared: -->

<!-- 1.  null: assumes no correlation across species and no covariate effects. -->
<!-- 2.  one: assumes one common correlation parameters across species and no covariate effects -->
<!-- 3.  cil: assumes no correlation across species but adds core cold intermediate layer (CIL) temperature as a covariate -->
<!-- 4.  cei: assumes no correlation across species but adds composite environmental index (CEI) as a covariate -->
<!-- 5.  cil_one: assumes one correlation parameter and adds core CIL temperature as a covariate -->
<!-- 6.  cei_one: assumes one correlation parameter and adds CEI as a covariate -->

<!-- Models are compared using marginal AIC -->

<!-- $$mAIC =  2k + 2log(\hat{L}),$$ -->

<!-- where $k$ is the number of fixed parameters and $log(\hat{L})$ is the negative log likelihood, and leave-one-out cross-validation score -->

<!-- $$LOOCV = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i-1}^{n} \left (  log(I_i) - log(\hat{I}_i) \right ) ^ 2$$ LOOCV is the mean squared error of the log estimates of the survey indices $\hat{I}$, under consecutive model runs where each observation $i$ was left out. For both metrics, lower values indicate models with greater predictive ability. -->
