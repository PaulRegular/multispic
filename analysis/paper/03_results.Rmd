Both cross-validation metrics (LOO-CV and Hindcast-CV scores) indicate that most multispecies production model formulations outperform a single-species production model when applied to seven species within three ecosystem production units (Northeast NL Shelf, Grand Bank, and Southern NL) off the east coast of Canada (Figure \@ref(fig:scores)). Focusing on overall scores, the performance of the single-species production model was similar to a multispecies formulation that assumes there is no correlation in the process errors across species or time. There tend to be more notable decreases in the scores as temporal and species correlations are introduced, indicating an improvement in the predictive ability of these models. The "shared correlation" and "just correlation" formulations, in particular, tended to receive the lowest scores, and dropping the species and temporal correlations in lieu of a shift covariate ("just shift" formulation) resulted in a deterioration of predictive ability. Scores were improved when temporal and species-to-species correlations were introduced along with the shift covariate ("full" formulation); however, the fit of the "full" model tended to be poorer than the "just correlation" formulation, which further indicates that the "shift" covariate degraded the predictive ability of the model. Subsequent plots focus on the best fitting formulation, "just correlation", to demonstrate model predictions.

The multispecies production model with unstructured species-to-species correlation and AR1 temporal correlation ("just correlation") offered an explanation of the trends in survey indices of focal species across three ecosystem production units with little signs of systematic bias (see residual plots included in model dashboards; Supplement 1). Predicted indices track observed values and, by estimating catchability parameters by species and survey, indices from temporally fragmented surveys are stitched together and their trends are used to inform a continuous underlying trend in biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-trends)). The earlier Yankee and Engel eras of the Canadian surveys tended to receive lower catchability estimates than the Campelen era survey; indices since 1996 therefore tend to be closer to the underlying estimates of biomass from the model.
