Rather than assuming that populations are primarily regulated by species-specific carrying capacities, our multispecies production model assumes that both intra and interspecific competition stunts growth as total biomass approaches the environment's maximal load. This assumption is conceptually similar to aggregate production models [@mueter2006; @bundy2012; @fogarty2012] as it is rooted in the idea that total production, and consequently system-level maximum sustainable yield (MSY), is limited by the amount of resources available in a given ecosystem. In contrast to aggregate production models, we also attempt to capture the dynamics of species within a community. Fisheries landings, competitive interactions, predation, and prey availability all affect species-level production [@schaefer1954; @lotka1925; @volterra1926]. While our model explicitly accounts for landings, species interactions are implicitly accounted for by estimating species-to-species correlations [sensu @albertsen2018; see @gamble2009 for a more explicit approach]. Finally, by utilizing a state-space framework akin to single-species state-space production models [e.g., @millar2000; @winker2018], we attempt to differentiate population processes from noise and bias introduced by surveys of fish populations. The overall structure of the model allows species-specific dynamics to be captured while avoiding the assumption that the dynamics of each species is isolated and independent from sympatric species.

Our case study focuses on the population dynamics of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada. This is an interesting use case since most stocks in the area collapsed in the early 1990s [@lear1998], and the relative contribution of fishing and environmental impacts remains uncertain [@pedersen2017]. We attempt to disentangle the impacts of fishing from environmental effects using our multispecies production model and, in doing so, we provide empirical evidence that environmental factors played a non-negligible role in the changes observed in the region. The focal species we studied all occupy the same ecosystem production unit and ultimately compete for the same resources [@pepin2014]. It follows that total production at upper trophic levels should be limited the regions' maximal load, which is evidenced in our case study by the general support for models that impose a system-level carrying capacity. Beyond this, we found evidence for synchronous changes in the demersal fish community, which implies that a common bottom-up driver is impacting the dynamics of these species [see also @bundy2012]. Finally, the contributions of these ecologically mediated process changes relative to fisheries landings indicate that fishing was not the sole cause of the collapses observed in the early 1990s.

Our inference that environmental factors were a key driver of stock collapses is surprising given the prevailing hypothesis is that fishing activity was the primary driver [e.g., @hutchings1996; @gomes1995; but see @morgan2002]. Since our model utilizes *reported* fisheries landings, a portion of these losses may be attributed to illegal fishing activity. However, it seems unlikely that the industry had the capacity to covertly exceed typical annual catches in the late 1980s. For instance, annual catches in the late 1980s across the Northeast NL Shelf and the Grand Bank totaled ~450 kt while residual losses estimated by the model in the early 1990s was ~1000 kt. The illegal fishery would have had to double its efforts to explain the declines. It follows that the decline must at least in part, if not primarily, be due to an unknown environmental driver. This contention is not new [see, for example, @atkinson1994; @pedersen2017], however, it remains contentious and perplexing as we lack specific causal explanations.

Regardless of the environmental driver behind the 1990s collapse, it is possible that the increasingly industrialized and intense fishing activity through the 1960s and 1970s reduced population diversity and, consequently, hampered the ability of the species within the community to buffer subsequent environmental changes [*sensu* the portfolio effect, @schindler2010]. Still, it is curious that heavily exploited species like Atlantic cod show no signs of change or loss of genetic diversity [@pinsky2021]. Another hypothesis is that fishing activity bounded the safe operating space of the system, triggering an alternate stable state [@scheffer2015]. While not a perfect test of chaotic dynamics, we did assess the possibility of a systematic shift in system-level carrying capacities and found little support for this hypothesis. That said, there were clear shifts in the communities in the region and these shifts may have emerged from the combined effects of interspecific competition and shifting energy pathways. It is well known that the dominant forage species in the area shifted from capelin to shrimp [@dawe2012] and this change was detrimental for cod [@regular2021; @link2019; @mullowney2014] and perhaps other piscivorous species that relied on capelin. Shrimp are an important prey item for redfish species [@brown2022], so it is possible that the increasing shrimp population helped support concurrent recruitment pulses of redfish. We admit that this conjecture is highly speculative; however, we add it as a simple example of how bottom-up forces may be driving the observed changes in the community. The reality is obviously more complex and the observed restructuring of the communities may be akin to the **paradox of plankton** where the continuous interaction of ecological and environmental factors give rise to "oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community" [@scheffer2003].

Robust conclusions are further hampered by the relatively short time-series of the monitoring programs used in our case study.

Main points in jot note form:

- Rather than assuming that populations are primarily regulated by species-specific carrying capacities, our multispecies production model assumes that both intra and interspecific competition stunts growth as total biomass approaches the environment's maximal load. 
- The structure of our model resolves an issue with applying the carrying capacity concept as it accounts for species interactions.
- Our case study of the population dynamics of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada demonstrates the utility of concurrently modeling the production of multiple sympatric species. 
- Account for correlated dynamics across species appears to be especially important and we provide empirical evidence of synchronous changes in the focal demersal fish community. These results imply effects from common bottom-up drivers.
- Populations across all three regions declined in the early 1990s. The prevailing hypothesis is that fisheries were the primary driver of these declines; however, results indicate that substantial subtractions from factors not related to *reported fishing activity* are required to explain the declines. A portion of these losses may be attributed to illegal fishing activity, but it seems unlikely that the industry had the capacity to covertly exceed typical annual catches in the late 1980s. For instance, annual catches in the late 1980s across the Northeast NL Shelf and the Grand Bank totaled ~450 kt while residual losses estimated by the model in the early 1990s was ~1000 kt. The illegal fishery would have had to double its efforts to explain the declines. It follows that the decline must at least in part, if not primarily, be due to an unknown environmental driver. (See also Pedersen).
- It is unclear whether the collapse represents a shift in the carrying capacity of the system; the model which assumes the systems capacity changed was not well supported relative to the other production model formulations. That said, there were clear shifts in the communities in the region. Interspecific competition may have contributed to these shifts, however shifting energy pathways may also be at play. Observed restructuring of the communities may be akin to the **paradox of plankton** where the continuous interaction of ecological and environmental factors give rise to "oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community" (Scheffer et al. 2003; https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1024404804748)
- While our multispecies production model accounts for more ecological interactions than standard single-species production models, it is still an imperfect abstraction of nature. Results indicate that total biomass in Northeast NL Shelf production unit was above the carrying capacity of that region in the 1980s. This result is at odds with historic records that suggest populations such as Northern cod were at substantially higher levels in the 1970s and earlier. However, it is possible that the 1970s represents a productive period when the system may have exceeded the carrying capacity.
- Results from the Grand Bank and Southern NL also indicate that the demersal fish community is currently dominated by redfish. Indeed, the system appears to be approaching its carrying capacity given these increases. However, this result may be an artifact of unrealistically low survey catchability estimates or the model's inability to properly account for year effects. Observation errors are assumed to be lognormally distributed, however, extreme catch events / black swan events in space (cite Anderson) can introduce 'year effects' that may be better accounted assuming the a distribution with heavier tails, such as the t-distribution.
- Consider discussing q estimates for Plaice.
- Consider discussing catch estimates. STATLANT used but imperfect.
- Wrap up: there is growing need to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, however, the data requirements of multispecies assessments models built to support ecosystem-informed decisions are often prohibitive. There are currently few data-limited approaches. We document a production model that can estimate the population dynamics of multiple stocks using commonly available landings and survey index data. The methods presented here may therefore represent a relatively tractable approach for informing management decisions for multiple sympatric and data-limited species.



**ChatGPT draft based on points:**

Paragraph 1:
Our multispecies production model assumes that both intra and interspecific competition stunts growth as total biomass approaches the environment's maximal load, rather than assuming that populations are primarily regulated by species-specific carrying capacities. This assumption is rooted in the idea that ecological interactions play a crucial role in shaping population dynamics, and that neglecting these interactions can lead to oversimplified and inaccurate predictions of population trajectories. By explicitly accounting for competition among species, our model provides a more nuanced understanding of how populations respond to changes in their environment. This approach is especially relevant in situations where species are ecologically intertwined and subject to similar environmental stressors.

Paragraph 2:
The structure of our model resolves an issue with applying the carrying capacity concept as it accounts for species interactions. Carrying capacity, defined as the maximum number of individuals of a species that can be supported by a given environment, has traditionally been a cornerstone of population ecology. However, this concept is often oversimplified by assuming that species exist in isolation from one another and that the environment has a fixed capacity for each species. By accounting for species interactions, our model provides a more accurate representation of how populations respond to changes in their environment, including factors such as predation, competition, and disease. This allows us to better predict how populations will respond to changes in management practices or other environmental stressors.

Paragraph 3:
Our case study of the population dynamics of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada demonstrates the utility of concurrently modeling the production of multiple sympatric species. This approach allows us to capture the complexity of the interactions among species, and to account for changes in the environment that affect the entire ecosystem. By modeling multiple species simultaneously, we can better understand how changes in the abundance of one species can affect the abundance of others, and how these changes ripple through the ecosystem. This information is crucial for developing sustainable management practices that account for the multiple uses of the ecosystem.

Paragraph 4:
Accounting for correlated dynamics across species appears to be especially important, and we provide empirical evidence of synchronous changes in the focal demersal fish community. These results imply effects from common bottom-up drivers. Our study shows that changes in the abundance of one species are often correlated with changes in the abundance of others, suggesting that these changes are driven by common factors such as climate change, nutrient availability, or predator-prey interactions. This underscores the importance of considering multiple species when developing management practices, as changes in one species may have unexpected consequences for others.

Paragraph 5:
Populations of commercially important demersal fish stocks in all three regions under investigation declined in the early 1990s. The prevailing hypothesis is that fisheries were the primary driver of these declines, but our results suggest that substantial subtractions from factors not related to reported fishing activity are required to explain the declines. For instance, annual catches in the late 1980s across the Northeast NL Shelf and the Grand Bank totaled approximately 450 kt, while residual losses estimated by the model in the early 1990s were approximately 1000 kt. It seems unlikely that illegal fishing activity could explain such a large difference since the industry would have had to double its efforts to do so. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that an unknown environmental driver contributed to the decline. This highlights the challenges of managing fisheries in the face of uncertain and changing environmental conditions. It also underscores the importance of considering a broad range of factors when developing management practices, including factors that may not be immediately apparent. Further research is needed to fully understand the environmental factors that contributed to the decline and how these can be managed to ensure the long-term sustainability of these fisheries. (See also Pedersen)

Paragraph 6:
Our case study showed clear shifts in the communities of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada. However, it is still unclear whether the collapse represents a shift in the carrying capacity of the system. The model which assumes the system's capacity changed was not well supported relative to the other production model formulations. This suggests that there may be other factors at play that contribute to the observed shifts in the ecosystem. One possible factor is the shifting energy pathways, which may be driven by changes in the physical environment, such as temperature or currents, or by the interaction of species in the ecosystem. Interspecific competition may have also contributed to these shifts. For example, competition for resources may have led to changes in the abundance of different species. However, it is difficult to determine the exact contribution of these different factors to the observed changes in the ecosystem. These shifts may be similar to the "paradox of plankton" where the continuous interaction of ecological and environmental factors gives rise to "oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community" (Scheffer et al. 2003). Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms driving these changes in the ecosystem and to develop effective management strategies for the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

Paragraph 7:
Our multispecies production model provides a useful framework for understanding the population dynamics of multiple species, but it is essential to consider its limitations when interpreting its results. The model accounts for more ecological interactions than standard single-species production models, but it is still an imperfect abstraction of nature. Our study's results indicate that total biomass in the Northeast NL Shelf production unit was above the carrying capacity of that region in the early 1990s. This finding contradicts historic records that suggest populations such as Northern cod were at substantially higher levels in the 1970s and earlier. However, it is possible that the 1970s represents a period of unusually high productivity, where the system may have exceeded the carrying capacity. It is important to bear in mind that our model is based on the best available data, and as more data becomes available, our understanding of the system's carrying capacity and dynamics may change.

Paragraph 8:
Additionally, results from the Grand Bank and Southern NL indicate that the demersal fish community is currently dominated by redfish, a result that may be due to unrealistically low survey catchability estimates or the model's inability to properly account for year effects. Observation errors are assumed to be lognormally distributed, but extreme catch events or black swan events in space can introduce 'year effects' that may be better accounted for by assuming a distribution with heavier tails, such as the t-distribution. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge the potential for errors in our model's results and to interpret them cautiously. Our study highlights the need for ongoing research and data collection to improve our understanding of the complex ecological interactions in the region and to develop effective management practices that can sustainably balance the needs of different species and stakeholders.

Paragraph 9:
In conclusion, there is a growing need to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. However, the data requirements of multispecies assessment models built to support ecosystem-informed decisions are often prohibitive. Our study documents a production model that can estimate the population dynamics of multiple stocks using commonly available landings and survey index data. This approach provides a relatively tractable method for informing management decisions for multiple sympatric and data-limited species. While our model has limitations, it represents a step forward in understanding the complex interactions among species in marine ecosystems and provides a framework for developing sustainable management practices.
