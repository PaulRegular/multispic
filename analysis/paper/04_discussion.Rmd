Main points:

Rather than assuming that populations are primarily regulated by species-specific carrying capacities, our multispecies production model assumes that both intra and interspecific competition stunts growth as total biomass approaches the environment's maximal load. 

The structure of our model resolves an issue with applying the carrying capacity concept as it accounts for species interactions.

Our case study of the population dynamics of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada demonstrates the utility of concurrently modeling the production of multiple sympatric species. 

Account for correlated dynamics across species appears to be especially important and we provide empirical evidence of synchronous changes in the focal demersal fish community. These results imply effects from common bottom-up drivers.
