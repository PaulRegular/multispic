Rather than assuming that populations are primarily regulated by species-specific carrying capacities, our multispecies production model assumes that both intra and interspecific competition stunts growth as total biomass approaches the environment's maximal load. This assumption is conceptually similar to aggregate production models [@mueter2006; @bundy2012; @fogarty2012] as it is rooted in the idea that total production, and consequently system-level maximum sustainable yield (MSY), is limited by the amount of resources available in a given ecosystem. In contrast to aggregate production models, we also attempt to capture the dynamics of species within a community. Fisheries landings, competitive interactions, predation, and prey availability all affect species-level production [@schaefer1954; @lotka1925; @volterra1926]. While our model explicitly accounts for landings, species interactions are implicitly accounted for by estimating species-to-species correlations [sensu @albertsen2018; see @gamble2009 for a more explicit approach]. Finally, by utilizing a state-space framework akin to single-species state-space production models [e.g., @millar2000; @winker2018], we attempt to differentiate population processes from noise and bias introduced by surveys of fish populations. The overall structure of the model allows species-specific dynamics to be captured while avoiding the assumption that the dynamics of each species is isolated and independent from sympatric species.

Our case study focuses on the population dynamics of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada. This is an interesting use case since most stocks in the area collapsed in the early 1990s [@lear1998], and the relative contribution of fishing and environmental impacts remains uncertain [@pedersen2017]. We attempt to disentangle the impacts of fishing from environmental effects using our multispecies production model and, in doing so, we provide empirical evidence that environmental factors played a non-negligible role in the changes observed in the region. The focal species we studied all occupy the same ecosystem production unit and ultimately compete for the same resources [@pepin2014]. It follows that total production at upper trophic levels should be limited the regions' maximal load, which is evidenced in our case study by the general support for models that impose a system-level carrying capacity. Beyond this, we found evidence for synchronous changes in the demersal fish community, which implies that a common bottom-up driver is impacting the dynamics of these species [see also @bundy2012]. Finally, the contributions of these ecologically mediated changes relative to fisheries landings indicate that fishing was not the sole cause of the collapses observed in the early 1990s.

Our inference that environmental factors were a key driver of stock collapses is surprising given the prevailing hypothesis is that fishing activity was the primary driver [e.g., @hutchings1996; @gomes1995; but see @morgan2002]. Since our model utilizes *reported* fisheries landings, a portion of these losses may be attributed to illegal fishing activity. However, it seems unlikely that the industry had the capacity to covertly exceed typical annual catches in the late 1980s. For instance, annual catches in the late 1980s across the Northeast NL Shelf and the Grand Bank totaled ~450 kt while residual losses estimated by the model in the early 1990s was ~1000 kt. The illegal fishery would have had to double its efforts to explain the declines. It follows that the decline must at least in part, if not primarily, be due to an unknown environmental driver. This contention is not new [see, for example, @atkinson1994; @pedersen2017], however, it remains contentious and perplexing as we lack specific causal explanations.

Regardless of the environmental driver behind the 1990s collapse, it is possible that increasingly industrialized and intense fishing activity through the 1960s and 1970s reduced population diversity and, consequently, hampered the ability of the species within the community to buffer subsequent environmental changes [*sensu* the portfolio effect, @schindler2010]. Still, it is curious that heavily exploited species like Atlantic cod show no signs of change or loss of genetic diversity [@pinsky2021]. Another hypothesis is that fishing activity bounded the safe operating space of the system, triggering an alternate stable state [@scheffer2015]. While not a perfect test of chaotic dynamics, we did assess the possibility of a systematic shift in system-level carrying capacities and found little support for this hypothesis. That said, there were clear shifts in the communities in the region and these shifts may have emerged from the combined effects of interspecific competition and shifting energy pathways. It is well known that the dominant forage species in the area shifted from capelin to shrimp [@dawe2012] and this change was detrimental for cod [@regular2021; @link2019; @mullowney2014] and perhaps other piscivorous species that rely on capelin. Shrimp are an important prey item for redfish species [@brown2022], so it is possible that the increasing shrimp population helped support concurrent recruitment pulses of redfish. We admit that this conjecture is highly speculative; however, we add it as a simple example of how bottom-up forces may be driving the observed changes in the community. The reality is obviously more complex and the observed restructuring of the communities may be akin to the **paradox of plankton** where the continuous interaction of ecological and environmental factors give rise to "oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community" [@scheffer2003].

Like all models, our multispecies production model is an imperfect abstraction of nature and while it may be useful in some contexts, it is important to consider its limitations when interpreting results. Our study's results indicate that total biomass in the Northeast NL Shelf production unit was above the carrying capacity of that region in the early 1990s. This finding contradicts historic records that suggest populations such as Northern cod were at substantially higher levels in the 1970s and earlier [@rose2004; @schijns2021]. Still, it is possible that the 1970s represents a period of unusually high productivity, where the system may have exceeded the carrying capacity. Results from the Grand Bank and Southern NL also indicate that the demersal fish community is currently dominated by redfish and, consequently, the system appears to be approaching its carrying capacity. Though redfish are currently rebounding in parts of eastern Canada [@cadigan2022], the implication that it dominates the community seems unrealistic. This result may be an artifact of low estimates survey catchability or the model's inability to properly account for year effects. Observation errors are assumed to be lognormally distributed, however, extreme catch events / black swan events in space can introduce 'year effects' that may be better accounted assuming the a distribution with heavier tails, such as the t-distribution [@anderson2019].

# Conclusion {-}

There is a growing need to apply an ecosystem based fisheries management [EBFM; @pikitch2004]. A robust understanding of the interactions of multiple species with each other and their environment is a critical prerequisite for advancing a EBFM. There are multiple analytically pathways to support such management, however, data requirements are often prohibitive [@latour2003]. Our study documents a production model that can estimate the population dynamics of multiple stocks using commonly available landings and survey index data. This approach provides a relatively tractable method for informing management decisions for multiple sympatric and data-limited species. While our model has limitations, it represents a step forward in understanding the complex interactions among species in marine ecosystems and provides a framework for supporting sustainable management decisions.
