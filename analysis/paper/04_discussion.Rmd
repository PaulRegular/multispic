Main points in jot note form:

- Rather than assuming that populations are primarily regulated by species-specific carrying capacities, our multispecies production model assumes that both intra and interspecific competition stunts growth as total biomass approaches the environment's maximal load. 
- The structure of our model resolves an issue with applying the carrying capacity concept as it accounts for species interactions.
- Our case study of the population dynamics of commercially important demersal fish stocks off the east coast of Canada demonstrates the utility of concurrently modeling the production of multiple sympatric species. 
- Account for correlated dynamics across species appears to be especially important and we provide empirical evidence of synchronous changes in the focal demersal fish community. These results imply effects from common bottom-up drivers.
- Populations across all three regions declined in the early 1990s. The prevailing hypothesis is that fisheries were the primary driver of these declines; however, results indicate that substantial subtractions from factors not related to *reported fishing activity* are required to explain the declines. A portion of these losses may be attributed to illegal fishing activity, but it seems unlikely that the industry had the capacity to covertly exceed typical annual catches in the late 1980s. For instance, annual catches in the late 1980s across the Northeast NL Shelf and the Grand Bank totaled ~450 kt while residual losses estimated by the model in the early 1990s was ~1000 kt. The illegal fishery would have had to double its efforts to explain the declines. It follows that the decline must at least in part, if not primarily, be due to an unknown environmental driver. (See also Pedersen).
- It is unclear whether the collapse represents a shift in the carrying capacity of the system; the model which assumes the systems capacity changed was not well supported relative to the other production model formulations. That said, there were clear shifts in the communities in the region. Interspecific competition may have contributed to these shifts, however shifting energy pathways may also be at play. Observed restructuring of the communities may be akin to the **paradox of plankton** where the continuous interaction of ecological and environmental factors give rise to "oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community" (Scheffer et al. 2003; https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1024404804748)
- While our multispecies production model accounts for more ecological interactions than standard single-species production models, it is still an imperfect abstraction of nature. Results indicate that total biomass in Northeast NL Shelf production unit was above the carrying capacity of that region in the early 1990s. This result is at odds with historic records that suggest populations such as Northern cod were at substantially higher levels in the 1970s and earlier. However, it is possible that the 1970s represents a productive period when the system may have exceeded the carrying capacity.
- Results from the Grand Bank and Southern NL also indicate that the demersal fish community is currently dominated by redfish; this result may be an artifact of unrealistically low survey catchability estimates or the model's inability to properly account for year effects. Observation errors are assumed to be lognormally distributed, however, extreme catch events / black swan events in space (cite Anderson) can introduce 'year effects' that may be better accounted assuming the a distribution with heavier tails, such as the t-distribution.
- Wrap up: there is growing need to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, however, the data requirements of multispecies assessments models built to support ecosystem-informed decisions are often prohibitive. There are currently few data-limited approaches. We document a production model that can estimate the population dynamics of multiple stocks using commonly available landings and survey index data. The methods presented here may therefore represent a relatively tractable approach for informing management decisions for multiple sympatric and data-limited species.
