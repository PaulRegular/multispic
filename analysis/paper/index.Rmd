  Carrying capacity is a fundamental concept in population ecology, yet standard models tend to ignore species interactions and do not account for variable environments. Our study proposes an extension of the single-species production model to include inter- and intra-specific competition within a community. We apply our extended model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada to assess its ability to reveal species interactions and the relative impacts of fishing and environmental factors. Our results indicate that accounting for ecological interactions increases the accuracy of biomass estimates for species within a community. Strongly correlated estimates of process error also adds nuance to previous notions that fishing was the primary driver of collapses in the region since common trends imply a common environmental driver. Such inferences indicate that this may be a promicing avenue for producing more accurate assessments for multiple species with relatively minimal data requrements. Finaly, this approach may serve as a steping stone towards an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.
